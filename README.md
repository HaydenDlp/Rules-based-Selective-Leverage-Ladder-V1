# Rules-based-Selective-Leverage-Ladder-V1
Rules-based “Selective Leverage Ladder”: start in 1× S&amp;P 500, add small 2× exposure at moderate drawdowns and optional 3× at deeper drawdowns, capped leverage, reset after new ATHs. Backtested via Monte Carlo (1957–2025) with simplified taxes + optional TLH.
